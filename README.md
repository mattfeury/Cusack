Cusack
======

Cusack is your Now Playing guide. Whenever you're playing music, Cusack will deliver you relevant content about the artist, album, and track:
- Biography (Wikipedia + Last.fm)
- Artist image
- Artist tweets
- One touch search for lyrics via RapGenius, Wikipedia, or Google.
These features will soon include:
- Tour dates
- Artist facebook integration
- Guitar tabs
- Ability to choose preferred lyric provider
- Ability to disable/customize the other modules
Cusack's goal is to be music player agnostic and fully customizable. It is a layer on top of whatever music player you use. We currently support only Google Play Music and Spotify, but support for arbitrary players is coming very soon.
Music listening is a passive activity. Layer Cusack on top to make it active and get to know your music.
